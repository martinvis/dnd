This arcane cauldron, crafted from dark, ancient iron, stands upon five stout legs that converge to form a perfect pentagon at its base. A favored tool among witches, it defies its outward dimensions by holding surprisingly vast volumes within its depths, seemingly larger on the inside than its exterior suggests. More than just a vessel, this enchanted pot possesses an eerie sentience, capable of clanking along on its five jointed limbs, faithfully following its master wherever they may wander.
