Hatched from a single, magical egg found only in the most ancient of enchanted forests, Guiding Ants are small but incredibly potent creatures. Their singular purpose is to lead their owner to any person, place, or thing they can conceive of. The ants' direction is always the most direct path, a straight line that pays no heed to any obstaclesâ€”be they mountains, rivers, or castle walls.

These creatures are notoriously difficult to keep in groups. Each colony is fiercely territorial, and placing two or more groups in close proximity has proven near impossible without inciting a tiny, but deadly, fight.
