Goldemar: The mine's leader consumed by avarice. Every missing miner is tallied in gold, a direct hit to his profits. His eyes gleam with calculating greed, prioritizing ore production over the lives of his workers. The missing miners represent an inconvenience in his ledger that requires a quick resolution with minimial disruption to his mining operations.

Grimm: He belittles everyone he meets, dismissing their concerns with cutting remarks and sneering criticisms. He finds joy in the discomfort of others, offering unhelpful advice laced with mockery. He'd rather watch the world burn than lift a finger to assist, convinced of his own superiority and everyone else's incompetence.

Amber: Superstition clings to her like cobwebs, and the unknown fills her with dread. The whispers of the "Deep Lurker" haunt her dreams, painting vivid pictures of monstrous shadows lurking in the darkest corners of the mines. Every creak of the rock sends shivers down her spine, and she clings to the others for comfort, her eyes wide with fear.

Magnus: He's driven by a burning desire to protect his fellow miners, viewing the disappearances as a personal affront. His eyes gleam with determination as he outlines plans, his voice booming with enthusiasm. He's eager to dive headfirst into the investigation, convinced that with enough courage he can uncover the truth and eliminate the threat.

Flint: He is a haze of ale and vague memories. He drifts through life in a perpetual state of mild inebriation, his words slurred and his thoughts muddled. While he might offer a drunken anecdote or two about the mines, his contributions to the investigation are more likely to involve stumbling into walls or regaling the group with tales of mythical creatures he swears he's encountered.
