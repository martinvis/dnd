The party awoke not in the afterlife, but in a bizarre underground prison. Stripped of all their gear, they were held captive by a race of snake-like people who spoke in a Draconic dialect. The group was split, with Grimm and Buzzbolt in one cell, and Yara and Chrono in another. After they regained some strength, their captors led them to a small kolloseum and forced them into a bare-handed fight against giant spiders — much to the horror of Buzzbolt. The party, however, refused to harm the spiders and instead attacked the guards. Yara even managed to befriend the spiders, but with the spider-like monsters under the snake-people's control, their attempt to escape was quickly thwarted. Yara, who had put up the fiercest fight, was the last to fall.

They awoke once more in their cells, but this time Yara was gone. But there was Brina, who had been captured while searching for them on her own. They learned from other captives that the snake-people were turning the strongest prisoners into obedient spider-monsters and killing the rest. When Yara finally returned, she seemed unchanged but now possessed the ability to shoot webs. Through a combination of observing the guards' access codes and Chrono's memory of a similar code in a fairy tale book remembered by Chrono, they opened their cells and orchestrated a mass breakout, freeing all the other captives. They moved through the tunnels, overpowering a few lone guards.

In a laboratory filled with books and ingredients — and a mysterious leaking green acid that was likely poisoning the surface trees — the party made a startling discovery. They found a captive spider-beast that begged for its release. They cautiously freed it, along with the giant spiders from the kolloseum. This beast showed great respect to Brina (and not-so-great to Grimm) and claimed to know the shortest route to the surface, a dangerous path guarded by a Hydra.

Brina convinced the group to follow this path, which led them past the skeletal remains of other former captives. They soon came face-to-face with the Hydra, a formidable beast that grew two heads for every one they defeated. After a brutal fight with heads that breathed fire and ice, they realized that attacking the head with the opposite element would kill it permanently. They finally defeated the monster and, hoping to use it for potions later, took some of its remains. They then followed a narrow upward tunnel that led them to the surface. Exhausted but alive, they returned to the wasp elf village.
