The party arrived in Wildhaven, dressed in casual clothes to blend in and avoid drawing unwanted attention. They were greeted by their stuttering guide, Marta, a former smuggler who had recently transitioned to guiding. Their fellow tourists included Brina, a young snow elf; Nela and her nearly immobile mother, Ingrid; and a pair of old friends, Otto and Donald, one hard of hearing and the other perpetually coughing. Yara quickly took a disliking to the constantly complaining Nela, spending most of her time instead with the amiable Otto and Donald.

The entire group journeyed through the wasp forests, learning to differentiate between male and female wasps, how to approach them safely, and much more about the local fauna. They eventually stumbled upon a small patch of completely dead forest where the wasps exhibited unusual aggression. Soon after, they had their first encounter with a wasp elf.

During the night, Nela and her mother sleepwalked away, a discovery the group made upon waking to find them missing. Worried, everyone set out to search for them, their steps ultimately leading them to a cave adorned with thick spiderwebs. Inside, they were attacked by several large, spider-like monsters. After killing the creatures in self-defense, they found Nela and Ingrid encased in cocoons, hanging from the ceiling. They freed the two women, and the group continued towards the village, with the magical cauldron now carrying the exhausted pair, as well as anyone else too tired to keep pace.
