On their journey from Campbell City to the dwarven mines,  the party encountered a heavily guarded coach, its soldiers warning of bandit activity along the path. Later that day, cries for help pierced the forest's tranquility. Yara secured the horses as Grim and Chrono cautiously advanced into the woods. They found a small clearing where a giant wasp hovered over a fallen old woman. A second wasp joined the fray, and though the party emerged victorious, they were too late to save the old woman, stung to death. Chrono retrieved a stinger, and they collected her gold. Believing her home being nearby due to her mushroom and berry gathering, they carried her body, searching for the hut.

Leading their horses through the dense undergrowth, they reached a barrier of bloodpines. Grim cut a path, a thorn grazing him, causing hallucinogenic visions of phantom crocodiles lurking on the foggy lake's edges. They decided to camp rather than search for the hut in the dark.

Their rest was broken in the morning by an attack from two young sorcerers, the deceased woman's sons. Believing the party responsible for their mother's death, the unarmed sorcerers used magic to control Grim, turning him against his companions. However, they underestimated the party's resolve, and as the party turned their weapons in self-defense, the sorcerers were forced to flee, barely escaping alive.

A terse message from Mr. Burns, expressing displeasure at their detour and missed deadline, prompted them to abandon the lake without vising the woman's hut. They continued towards the mines, the corpse still in tow, their mission awaiting them.
