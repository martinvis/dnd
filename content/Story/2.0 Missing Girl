The group sought a new mission and an opportunity to earn extra gold during their free time. They were scheduled to depart with the mage Gandalin to the elven lands in three days, tasked with opening a mysterious chest with the help of a strong cleric there. Among the various notices, they found a wanted poster for Falco, offering a reward for his capture, dead or alive. They proceeded to Chief Investigator Walter for more details on the case.

They found Walter busy investigating potion thefts from the previous day. Using magic, he located the potions on Chrono, Grim disliked Walter's suspicions. Chrono managed to shake off suspicion by producing a faked receipt, but Grim's aggressive behavior resulted in him spending the night in a cell. They learned Falco is the prime suspect in several recent murders in his home village, besides the disappearance of Alice, daughter of the wealthy family whose father promised the reward. From Alice's father, they learned Falco had been meeting Alice and had abducted her, or worse, as she would never have chosen him otherwise.

They traveled to the nearby village of Alfaro to investigate the recent crimes there, asking every person they met. With a few weeks between each case, there was first a disappearance of a hunter in the forest, then a massacre of a whole family in their house. They found traces of magic nearby that suddenly disappeared into thin air. Some of them tried the local cabbage wine at an inn. Later, they followed Falco's father and eventually convinced him to talk with them. He did not believe for one second his son was guilty of either the abduction or the subsequent murders and thought he was being framed.

After a busy day, the group decided to spend the cold night in the only empty house they were aware of: the one where the whole family had been killed. They plan to follow Falco's father as they suspect he might be in contact with Falco and want to keep a close eye on him.

The night, however, turned out to be much less quiet than they'd hoped. They were abruptly woken by an angry spirit, which not only gave them a fright but also magically aged both Chrono and Grim. Grim, particularly, felt the debilitating effects, becoming significantly weaker and slower due to his advanced age. Though they quickly helped the restless spirit to cross over, the lingering magical aging effects remained.
