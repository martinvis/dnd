The party emerged into a vast cavern, illuminated by the eerie glow of phosphorescent fungi. There, they encountered strange, bipedal, amphibious beings, their cautious curiosity mirroring the party's own. Communication proved challenging, their language an enigma. However, the drake egg they carried sparked keen interest, and upon gifting it, the creatures led them to their village with newfound warmth.

This frogfolk village, a vibrant anomaly, featured roofless, colorful dwellings nestled near flowing river, perpetually bathed in artificial rain. The village herbalist helps concocting an antidote from the drake's acid, restoring Magnus to life. Stranded, the party spent weeks among the frogfolk, Chrono diligently learning their language through Belza’s patient tutelage. Their diet consisted of fish, algae, and snails gathered from the surrounding waters.

Chieftain Heqeb, though tolerant, warned against venturing to the nearby forbidden city, home to a magical library—a warning Chrono, predictably, disregarded. Conversations with Belza’s mother revealed the village’s recent isolation, and their perception of the surface was a bizarre tapestry of dragons, purple trees, acidic storms, and falling stones. The village's history spoke of magicians and dragon hunters, now absent, though Belza harbored dreams of reviving those lost arts.

The frogfolk's golems, animated by gemstones akin to the drake's heartstones and imbued with magical abilities through spell scrolls housed within their stony forms, performed essential daily labor. This technology, however, was a relic of their past, a skill lost in the cataclysm that isolated their village.

After repeated complaints from the villagers, the party finally buried the decaying juvenile drake carcass, and with a shared sense of inevitable curiosity, they set their sights on the forbidden city.
