After an arduous journey, the party at last arrived in the city of the wasp elves. This unique settlement, a natural extension of the forest itself, consisted of dwellings carved into and built around massive trees. While most of the group took a much-needed break, the party's adventurers sought out the village leaders. Their goal was to share their terrifying recent experience with strange, spider-like creatures.

The party was directed to Buzzbolt, a respected local fauna expert and a great enthusiast of the forest's natural giant spiders, which are rare, protected, and cherished members of the forest's ecosystem. Upon hearing the party's descriptions, Buzzbolt grew increasingly concerned. The creatures they described were clearly not the beloved spiders he knew; they were something else entirely.

Not wasting any time, Buzzbolt insisted on investigating the bodies and learning more about this worrying threat. Much to Buzzbolt's surprise and admiration, Yara was able to calm a group of docile wasps, allowing the party to fly back to the tunnels together with him. Once there, however, they were shocked to find no trace of the monsters they had recently slain.

Driven by a mix of curiosity and a desire for answers, the group pressed deeper into the cave. This proved to be a decision they quickly came to regret. They soon found a larger group of the same monsters. Exhausted from their journey and previous battle, the party was gradually overwhelmed. One by one, they fell victim to the monsters' sticky webs and relentless attacks. The situation became hopeless as everyone was either killed or rendered unconscious, including Chrono's faithful dog, who took his last, gasping breath in the struggle.
