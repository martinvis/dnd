Yara, the elven cleric, Chrono, the elven wizard, and Grim, the human paladin, were called before Corinth's leadership. They were told they were now a special corps team, under Mr. Burns, who clearly wasn't happy about it. Paladin Chief Van Steel and the elven leader Kaia were there too, making it clear this was about getting humans and elves to work together. They were given what seemed like a simple job: find out why dwarves were disappearing from the adamantium mines. Mr. Burns made it sound like it was probably nothing—maybe the dwarves just got lost, drunk, or had a tunnel collapse on them—but it was a way to conveniently remove them from his sight.

They were introduced to Sonya, their handler, who would be in daily contact, relaying updates and tasks from Mr. Burns. Grim was picked as their leader.

Later, they went to an armory shop for some new weapons. Through intense negotiation with Adam, they secured their arms at a cheep price, albeit at the cost of two future favors, binding them to the shop owner's needs. Happy with their new gear, they left. Grim, needing a moment, ducked into a dark alley. He stirred up some rats, which attacked him. Chrono tried to help but accidentally burned Grim instead. Yara healed Grim's wounds, and they went to sleep in the barracks.

The next morning, they teleported to the temple of Helia in Campbell City, where horses were waiting to take them to the mines.
