The party's journey began with a grueling underwater trek through a submerged tunnel, a test of endurance that pushed them to their limits. Chrono, the ever-resourceful mage, navigated the treacherous passage with surprising grace, while the others struggled, emerging on the far side gasping for air. Regaining their composure, they ventured into the eerie silence of an abandoned frogfolk city, a place steeped in mystery and decay.

Their exploration took a perilous turn when Chrono stumbled upon an ornate chest, its alluring appearance masking a deadly secret. As the party gathered around, eager for treasure, a powerful fireball erupted, engulfing them in flames and leaving them severely burned. After a period of rest and healing, they pressed on, their senses heightened, moving cautiously through the ruins. They discovered a hidden chamber, its entrance guarded by another potential trap, and found another gemstone, similar to the one they had claimed from the medusa drake's corpse.

Their progress was abruptly halted by the imposing figure of a golem, standing guard on a pedestal. The golem, though slightly damaged, remained active and issued a stern command for them to leave the city. Ignoring its warning, the party found themselves under attack. The golem's magic slowed their movements, particularly Grimm, and suppressed their own magical abilities. Its powerful blows landed with devastating force, while their counterattacks proved largely ineffective. In a moment of brilliance, Chrono used his Mage Hand to deftly remove the golem's control scrolls, effectively deactivating the construct.

Exploring further, they uncovered a hidden library, a treasure trove of magical knowledge and artifacts. Among the spoils were a flaming sword, armor crafted from dragon scales, a large, blank book imbued with unknown magic, and a collection of valuable spellbooks. Laden with their newfound riches, they returned to the sealed chamber, momentarily forgetting the dangers that lay within. They triggered another explosion, leaving all but Yara, protected by her new armor, unconscious. Yara's quick thinking and healing skills saved the party. 

Within the chamber, they encountered a complex puzzle, written in the indecipherable frogfolk language. Through careful observation and logical deduction, they discovered it was a numerical puzzle, and managed to solve it. This revealed six intricately crafted necklaces and a mysterious, unopenable box.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a determination to leave no stone unturned, the party dedicated another day to exploring the city's labyrinthine dead-end tunnels. While investigating one narrow passage, they were ambushed by a stone drake of terrifying speed and ferocity. It struck Chrono and snatched the large gemstone they had recovered from the golem's chest. Unlike drakes they had encountered before, it possessed a strong sense of self-preservation, retreating after a deep wound inflicted by Grimm. 

Curiousity finally satisfied and everyone laden with treasure, they returned through the underwater tunnel to the frogfolk village.
