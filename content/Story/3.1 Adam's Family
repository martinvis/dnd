After a long and arduous journey, the party finally returns to the familiar comfort of home. Party immediately the party head to the Special Corps central office and brief Mr. Burns. They learn that the necklaces, along with a prototype anti-magic armor made from the new metal called Validium, have been stolen. Validium is the name given to a special metal they discovered earlier within frogfolk tunnels. Grimm's necklace is the only one remaining, and now that it's bonded to him, it can't be passed to a more capable agent. In their absence, they received a letter from Belza, thanking them for the necklace. The letter was accompanied by several spell books and a manual for creating golems, all for Chrono.

With their monthly salaries paid and no immediate assignments, the party has some free time. They visit their friend Adam, a local armorer who helped them in the past. Adam confides that he's been having a serious problem: precious items are disappearing from his house. He and his wife, Eva, suspect their maid, but the party quickly grows suspicious of Eva's brother, Peter, a seemingly successful man who works for the famous businessman Alistair.

The party, believing Peter may be stealing from his family and selling the items through Alistair, decides to take action. They bring Peter in for questioning, but his involvement in the thefts remains unclear. The party then takes matters into their own hands, going to one of Alistair's establishments. They lie their way into his private room and confront him, accusing him of being an accomplice in the thefts and a receiver of stolen goods. Alistair, however, claims that Peter is a drug addict and that he had already cut ties with him because he was stealing from him as well. The argument escalated until Alistair reached for a magical artifact from a nearby shelf. As it was activated, everyone collapsed into a deep slumber, only Chrono remained on his feet, his mind strong enough against the effect.

Chrono uses this opportunity to investigate the room, finding evidence of Peter's contract termination as well as several ledgers that point to Alistair's tax evasion. He is interrupted when guards and senior investigator Walter arrive. As the party and Alistair wake up, they start accusing each other of various crimes â€” from violent ambush to tax evasion. Walter takes down both sides of the story, leaving it to the court to decide their fate.

Back at the Special Corps, Van Steel confirms that Peter is not connected to the larger thefts. Adam, wanting to keep things within the family, decides not to press charges against Peter, opting to just get his items back and arrange for his rehab. Peter admits that he sold everything to a pawn shop in the city's poorest sector.
