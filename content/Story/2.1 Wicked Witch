The next morning, the group shadowed Falco's father into the forest, leading them to an abandoned hut where they found both Falco and his father. The pair managed to dispel the party's initial suspicions, revealing that Falco was hiding from the guards while earnestly searching for Alice, whom he loves deeply. With her father opposing their relationship, they planned to leave the area together.

Realizing the magical aging curse was becoming permanent, Chrono and Grim urgently returned to the city to seek help from the priests of Helia. The ritual, however, proved costly. Chrono resorted to paying with a fake 500-gold cheque, while Grim's payment was accompanied with loud protestations.

Back at the hut as dusk fell, the reunited group split up to search the forest for Alice. The party soon encountered rabid wolves, relentlessly attacking until the last one was quickly dispatched by the now revitalized Grim. Following a beautiful woman, they were invited into her hut, where she offered them food and drink, repeatedly urging them to partake. Their suspicions flared when she claimed to be Alice's mother and also searching for her, especially as she resembled Alice. Confronting her, their unease proved justified; she was a witch attempting to poison them.

The hut's windows and door sealed and the witch quickly incapacitated Grim, but Yara's healing brought him back into the fight, allowing them to overpower her. Despite her pleas for mercy and promises of great rewards, Grim mercilessly killed her. With her last dying breath she cursed Grim for the rest of his days. 

In the cellar, they found an unconscious Alice, and outside a dozen pigs that might once have been people. A search of the hut yielded potion ingredients, journals, and a magical cauldron filled with blood and other remains. While resting after a difficult fight, Chrono deciphered the witch's journals, discovering she was indeed Alice's mother, planning to turn Alice into a witch through a series of rituals requiring human sacrifice. Yara bonded with the cauldron, which was bigger on the inside and capable of walking on its own. Grim, meanwhile, found himself plagued by nightmares, making true rest impossible.

Finally, they brought Alice, healthy, to Falco and his father, who were overjoyed to see her again. The party gave Falco and Alice some gold, promising to spread the lie that they had both been killed by the witch, thus enabling them to start a new life together, free from Alice's father's bounty hunters.
