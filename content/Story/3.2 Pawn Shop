The party makes their way through a poverty-stricken neighborhood, a stark contrast to the city's more prospering areas. They pass by addicts and beggars, tossing a few coins to get them to back off. They soon reach a pawn shop and meet its unique owners: Caleb and James, a pair of conjoined twins who go by the name CJ. CJ confirms he/they bought the stolen items from Peter for a good price but insists they had no idea the items were stolen. With Adam present, the party is able to settle the matter by partially compensating CJ for the loss.

On their way back, they are suddenly confronted by a trio of aggressive youngsters â€” two boys and a girl. These likely orphaned children try to rob them, but the party is reluctant to harm them. To their surprise, the kids put up a real fight. The young girl can fly, and one of the boys breathes fire, leaving the party with some scratches and burns. Still trying to avoid a serious confrontation, they manage to outrun the children and escape.

As Chrono eagerly delves into the books from Belza, he successfully learns some new spells. However, his excitement turns to peril when he attempts to read the Manual of Golems. The book proves to be far beyond his current magical abilities, and he suffers a crippling mental backlash, seemingly as if he simply fell asleep over the book. He would likely have died, but for the Frostbow he received from Brina warning Grimm of Chrono's dire state. Grimm is now able to communicate with the weapon - thanks to one of the gems in his necklace.

Back at the Special Corps, Mr. Burns has new information. His spies have confirmed that the necklaces were stolen by a neighboring kingdom, a nation already on the brink of war with their own. Amidst this tension, a young gnome arrives after a long journey, seeking help with a baby dragon that is terrorizing the lands north of both kingdoms. The gnomes, ever since having declared a republic and their independence from the elves, are hesitant to ask for help from the elvish monarchy.

Mr. Burns sees this as a perfect opportunity to gain the goodwill of the gnomes, which could be a crucial alliance in the looming conflict. He assigns the mission to Grimm's group, noting that the more experienced teams are busy and that Grimm, with his powerful necklace, should be more than capable of handling a "small lizard." They are instructed to first teleport to Este Verde, the former capital of the kingdom. From there, they have three options to reach the rural gnome lands: brave the treacherous mountains inhabited by giants, cross the pirate-infested swamps, or journey through the magical forest. The party chooses to go through the forest, avoiding the mountains and swamps, considering it a good opporunity to come across some unicorns.
