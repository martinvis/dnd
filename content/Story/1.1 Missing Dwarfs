The party, bearing the corpse and leading their horses, finally reached the dwarven village. Their arrival led them directly to Goldemar, the mine's avaricious owner, whose primary concern was the financial burden of compensating the missing dwarves' families, rather than the dwarves' fate. He pressed for a swift resolution to maintain the flow of adamantium and his profits.

Conversations with the village's inhabitants painted a varied picture: Flint, perpetually inebriated and unreliable; Grimm, dismissive and openly hostile; Amber, superstitious and fearful; and Magnus, the eager and brave dwarf willing to assist in their exploration. They learned the missing dwarves were all explorers, delving into old, abandoned tunnels and interconnected cave systems in search of adamantium.

Within the mine's depths, they discovered a chamber containing dwarven ale and the crystallized skeleton of a dwarf at the bottom of a saline lake. The tunnels, unstable and prone to cave-ins, presented constant danger. They ventured into the least explored caves, where mining had ceased, navigating tunnels choked with toxic gases.

They stumbled upon a petrified dwarf, frozen in time, seemingly far older than the skeletal remains they had found. Shortly after, they encountered a monstrous creature, its many legs scuttling across the stone, its body encased in a thick, stone-like carapace. This beast was the source of the petrification.

A desperate retreat, avoiding its gaze, led to a furious battle. Magnus, aiding them, was petrified in the struggle. The beast, though injured, retaliated with vicious bites, Grim narrowly avoiding death thanks to Yara's healing. Chrono's errant fire ignited the tunnel's gases, causing a ceiling collapse that trapped the creature, allowing them to deliver the final blow.

Exploring the creature's remains, they found its stomach acid, a gemstone where its heart might have been, and an egg with a juvenile, capable of only limited petrification. After debate, they decided to euthanize the juvenile, deeming it too dangerous to raise.

With Grim carrying the petrified Magnus and Chrono carrying the juvenile's corpse, they pressed on, their return path blocked by the cave-in. They were then attacked by another of the petrifying monsters, and only escaped by sliding down an underground river through a narrow tunnel.
