Upon returning to the city, the party found themselves promptly summoned by Van Steel and Mr. Burns. News had reached the chief of Helia's paladins that Chrono's recent payment to the temple had been a fake, leading to an official complaint. Mr. Burns, having studied the forged cheque with Gandalin, was less concerned with the fraud itself and more astonished by its remarkable quality, eager to learn its origins. Van Steel, however, focused squarely on the deception. After extensive discussion, Chrono admitted the page came from a magical book found in the Frogfolk village, reluctantly handing over a few hundred additional pages, all torn from the tome he secretly kept, knowing it would eventually regenerate them.

Mr. Burns, impressed by the magical forgery, finally agreed to overlook Chrono's transgression. However, the party's planned work with Gandalin on the mysterious chest was put on hold. Their new mission: to travel undercover as tourists to the Wildhaven Wasp Reservation. Their task is to investigate a recent surge in wasps flying south, a matter outside the kingdom's official jurisdiction.

With the magical cauldron still filled with unsettling contents, the group decided to empty it behind the city, beginning to dig an unmarked grave. Grim, however, was suddenly called away by a guard with an urgent message. Following the guard just outside the city, near the party's macabre task, both Grim and the guard were ambushed by crossbow fire and magical attacks. The guard immediately turned on Grim, revealing himself and his accomplice to be the twin brothers who had previously attacked the party, still consumed by their quest for revenge for their mother. Despite the element of surprise, the twins proved too weak to secure any kills. They were, however, swift enough to evade capture, escaping into the night with a lingering promise of future vengeance.

Grim, realizing his curse would make him more tired with each passing day, tried local options for lifting the latest curse in his collection, but unlike the aging, it proved much stronger and more difficult to remove. His only remaining options were powerful elven mages or reincarnation – the former being off-limits as Gandalin was going to the elves without them, and the latter being too drastic to seriously consider. Everyone, exhausted both physically and mentally, went to take a good rest before leaving on their new mission the next morning – everyone, of course, except Grim.
