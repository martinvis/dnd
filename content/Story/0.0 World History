For tens of thousands of years, ancient dwarven tribes roamed the western lands while elven clans—whose smallest descendants would later be known as gnomes—thrived in the east, their territories separated by deep, narrow seas. During that long era, internal conflicts within each race were more frequent than clashes between them.

Then, in what felt like only a few generations to the original inhabitants, entirely new peoples suddenly emerged. First came humans, who multiplied at an astonishing rate and soon dominated most of the continent—so much so that the ancient ways of the dwarves began to fade from memory as some tribes were no more. The humans even usurped the dwarven deities, adopting gods such as Helia and Gaia as their own, while pushing the dwarves into ever-more isolated, mountainous refuges. Today, mostly the mountain-dwelling dwarven tribes survive, many of other ancestral groups having perished. It is believed that humans favored Helia—resembling one of their old gods—a fact now preserved chiefly by dwarven scholars, as human recollection of their past is fleeting.

Meanwhile, the elves managed to retain control of their northern lands, keeping them largely free from human encroachment, and for a time, they seemed content with their hold on the territory. Then the orcs arrived, outpacing humans in both birth and death, and further shifting the balance of power.

After long years of diplomatic efforts, state boundaries have finally stabilized, and the races now coexist in a fragile peace. A living monument to this tenuous unity is the new capital of Esturia — Corinth city. Unlike other kingdoms where at most two races mix in major urban centers, Corinth is divided into four distinct quarters: the western sectors are home to dwarves and humans, while the eastern districts shelter elves and gnomes. This unprecedented cooperation has spurred new advances; for instance, in the eastern mountains, dwarven metallurgists are pioneering work on metals with extraordinary properties, including the highly prized Adamantium.

Yet, not everything is harmonious. Despite the tentative alliances, deep-seated animosity—especially between elves and humans—persists. Moreover, strange and fearsome beasts have recently been sighted across Esturia.
