Upon their return, the party engaged in negotiations with Heqeb, the frogfolk leader. They brokered a tentative agreement between the frogfolk and the dwarves, trading drake eggs and access to surface lands for three library books and access to the frogfolks' metals - adamantium and the unknown ore. Notably, the party withheld information regarding the necklaces and the enigmatic, unopenable box.

Belza then guided them through the treacherous tunnels, facilitating their passage through otherwise impassable terrain. Along the way, they discovered another petrified dwarf, a friend of Magnus, whom they added to their company. After a prolonged period of disorientation, they were rescued by a floating eye, which safely led them to the elevator and back to the surface.

They learned that the eye was a remote monitoring operated by Trollicus, a mage recently employed by Goldemar to defend mines against drakes and ensure worker safety. They also discovered that a dozen workers had been laid off due to these increased security costs. Trollicus, burdened by gambling debts, agreed to identify their newly acquired items for a fee. However, he was unable to open the magically sealed box. The party pledged to assist him in resolving his debts.

Leaving Belza with the dwarves, they returned to Campbell, accompanied by Magnus. The priests successfully restored Magnus's friend Aksels to his natural state. They then teleported to Corinth to report their findings to Mr. Burns. He expressed satisfaction with their success and allowed them to keep the armor and sword. However, he requested the gems, necklaces, and the sealed box for further analysis. A tense standoff ensued as Grimm resisted relinquishing these items, ultimately yielding, though both sides parted with lingering resentment.

Following the receipt of their salaries, the party embarked on a shopping expedition. During this excursion, Yara and Chrono discreetly acquired several potions through theft. Despite this minor transgression, the party concluded their day in high spirits, eager for their next adventure.
