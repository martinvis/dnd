A Werewolf is a magical beast whose curse is spread by its bite. While it lives as a normal person by day, the curse awakens at night, transforming the individual into a fearsome monster.

Common folklore speaks of the moon's power, but these tales are dangerously misguided. The truth is far more mysterious: a werewolf's power is not tied to the moon, but instead flows from the distant starlight itself.

While these creatures are incredibly difficult to kill due to their extremely potent regenerative abilities, their weakness is the touch of silver - the only metal capable of neutralizing their rapid healing.
