A monstrous drake characterized by its multiple serpentine heads, each capable of unleashing either searing gouts of flame or chilling blasts of ice. Its terrifying regenerative ability means that for every head severed, two new ones rapidly sprout forth in its place, making it an incredibly difficult foe to truly vanquish. The potent blood and various body parts of these beasts are highly prized, often utilized by snake people in their twisted alchemical and biological experiments. Specimens with too many heads frequently descend into internal strife, their numerous maws turning on each other in a chaotic frenzy, which is why wild Hydras rarely possess more than half a dozen heads at any given time.
