This drake, a creature of deceptive stillness, blends seamlessly with the rocky terrain when dormant, appearing as little more than a peculiar outcropping. However, once roused, it reveals a startling agility and speed, capable of swift and devastating attacks. Its powerful jaws, lined with teeth sharp enough to crush stone, are used to consume both carrion and living prey, with a particular fondness for gemhearts, which it can detect from great distances. 

Despite its formidable strength and speed, the drake is fundamentally opportunistic, avoiding confrontation with clearly superior foes and preferring to prey on the weak or unsuspecting. The drake possesses a unique ability to traverse underground, allowing it to retrieve buried gemhearts as well as escape when necessary.

Essentially a living ambush predator, this drake combines the patience of a stone with the ferocity of a sudden attack, making it a dangerous scavenger and hunter in any rocky environment.
