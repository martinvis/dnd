Stone golems are constructs crafted by frog people artisans, animated by a gemstone heart embedded within their stony forms. These golems serve as guardians or laborers, their actions dictated by magical scrolls within their bodies. These scrolls grant them commands and even spell-like powers, making them versatile servants.

While typically medium-sized, frog people can create larger versions for grander purposes, such as guarding temples or acting as siege engines.
