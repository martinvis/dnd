The Giant Wasps  are a species of wasp that are native to the elven lands around Rosewell; fast, agile and highly venomous.

Their stingers are tipped with a potent neurotoxin that can paralyze and even kill. The wasps are not typically aggressive, but they will attack if they feel threatened.

Recently, the Giant Wasps of Rosewell have begun to appear in areas far south of their traditional range. This is a cause for concern, as it is unknown what is causing this migration.
