The Medusa Drake is a grotesque anomaly, a reptilian horror birthed from some unseen, unnatural realm. Its massive form is encased in a shell of jagged, stone-like plates, giving it the appearance of a living, moving boulder. Slow and deliberate in its movements, it possesses a chilling patience, a stark contrast to the terror it inspires. 

Its gaze, a swirling vortex of malevolent energy, holds the power of petrification, turning flesh and bone to unyielding stone in an instant. This terrifying ability serves not only as a weapon but also as a morbid larder, as the drake collects its petrified prey, preserving them as macabre food reserves. 

Its jaws, lined with teeth like obsidian shards, deliver a bite that crushes and rends with terrifying force.

This creature is an aberration, a foreign entity in this world, and its existence is a chilling testament to the unknown terrors that lurk beyond the veil of reality.
